# Overview
Prepare for questions about **data structures**, **algorithms** and **system design** (*architecture*).
Spend some time curating your resume and focus on complex projects that you can discuss in depth. Once interviewing, drive the
conversation and show what you know.

# How to prepare
Build a system to practice technical skills. Write daily notes with tips, tricks and what needs improvement or more research.
It took me about 2 months of deliberate practice and preparation for my interviews. I spent about 20 hours/week, or 80 hours/month, learning and writing notes on top of a full time job.
